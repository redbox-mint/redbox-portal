# Tasks: Form Status & Events Management

1. [X] Scaffold `form-state` module plumbing under `angular/projects/researchdatabox/form/src/app/form-state/`, exporting `provideFormFeature()` that registers the `'form'` reducer and `FormEffects` via standalone providers; cover with a provider wiring unit test. (R1.1, R1.2, R1.3, R14.1)
2. [X] Define `FormFeatureState`, initial state, and action creators in `form-state/state/`, implement a pure reducer handling load/submit/reset/validation transitions, and add reducer tests for default state, each transition, and unknown actions. (R2.1–R2.14, R3.1, R4.1, AC1–AC17, AC22)
3. [X] Implement memoized selectors (`selectStatus`, `selectIsInitializing`, `selectBridgeSnapshot`, etc.) in `form-state/state/` and verify memoization/derivations with selector tests. (R6.1, R6.2, R10.1, AC10, AC11, AC21, AC23)
4. [ ] Build NgRx effects (`loadInitialData$`, `submitForm$`, `resetAllFields$`, validation lifecycle flows) in `form-state/effects/` with error sanitisation and diagnostics logging, plus marble tests covering success, failure, gating, and error channels. (R4.2–R4.7, R5.1–R5.4, R10.3, R11.1–R11.4, AC2–AC17, AC41)
5. [ ] Implement `FormEventBus` service in `form-state/events/` providing publish/Observable/Signal APIs, scoped channels, and auto teardown, alongside unit tests for ordering, fan-out, performance guard, and naming helpers. (R15.1–R15.19, AC26–AC36)
6. [ ] Create `FormEventBusAdapterEffects` to promote qualifying events into actions with throttling, diagnostics toggles, and optional registration, including tests for each promotion criterion and disablement. (R15.20–R15.29, AC37–AC44)
7. [ ] Deliver `FormStateFacade` and `FormStatusSignalBridge` in `form-state/facade/`, exposing signals, imperative APIs, snapshot helpers, and preventing direct status mutation, with facade/bridge unit tests validating signal outputs and dirty diff behaviour. (R7.1–R7.7, R8.1–R8.7, R16.4, R16.7–R16.17, AC18–AC21, AC57–AC58)
8. [ ] Refactor `FormComponent` to consume the facade/bridge for load, submit, reset, and validation workflows, dispatch dirty/pristine actions, and remove direct status mutations while keeping existing templates intact; extend component tests to assert new dispatch paths. (R16.1–R16.16, AC52–AC56)
9. [ ] Add an Angular TestBed integration spec bootstrapping `FormComponent` with the new providers to verify INIT→READY, reset propagation, and facade observability without runtime errors. (R12.4, R12.5, R16.12, AC52, AC59)
10. [ ] Update developer docs (e.g., form README snippet) describing facade/event bus consumption and event naming diagnostics to satisfy documentation requirements. (R11.4, R13.1–R13.3, R15.26)
