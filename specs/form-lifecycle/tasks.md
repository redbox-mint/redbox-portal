# Tasks: Form Lifecycle Feature

This document outlines the implementation steps for the form lifecycle feature, based on the requirements and design context.

---

## 1. Update FormStatus Enum
- [ ] Add `VALIDATION_PENDING` to the `FormStatus` enum in `status.model.ts`.

## 2. Enhance FormComponent
- [ ] Monitor the `form` (FormGroup) for async validation state using `statusChanges`.
- [ ] When `form.pending` is `true`, set status to `FormStatus.VALIDATION_PENDING`.
- [ ] When async validation completes (`form.pending` becomes `false`), revert to the appropriate status (e.g., `READY`).

## 3. Update SaveButtonComponent
- [ ] Accept a `formReady` or `canSave` input (boolean) from the parent.
- [ ] Disable the Save button if the form is not ready (including when status is `VALIDATION_PENDING` or `SAVING`).

## 4. Component Interaction
- [ ] Expose a property or observable in `FormComponent` indicating readiness (not pending, valid, etc.).
- [ ] Ensure `SaveButtonComponent` consumes this property to determine its enabled/disabled state.

---

## Optional/Stretch
- [ ] Add tests to verify the new lifecycle and button behavior.
- [ ] Update documentation and code comments as needed.
