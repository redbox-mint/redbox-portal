# Ralph Wiggum Loop - Iteration 2

You are in an iterative development loop. Work on the task below until you can genuinely complete it.

## Your Task

Follow implementation_plan.md and task.md. Work on 1 task in the task list at a time and mark your progress in it then stop execution. We'll start the next task next time. When you complete a task, output <promise>PENDING</promise> and stop. If you start and find there are no tasks left in the task list, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Instructions

1. Read the current state of files to understand what's been done
2. **Update your todo list** - Use the TodoWrite tool to track progress and plan remaining work
3. Make progress on the task
4. Run tests/verification if applicable
5. When the task is GENUINELY COMPLETE, output:
   <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

## Critical Rules

- ONLY output <promise>COMPLETE</promise> when the task is truly done
- Do NOT lie or output false promises to exit the loop
- If stuck, try a different approach
- Check your work before claiming completion
- The loop will continue until you succeed
- **IMPORTANT**: Update your todo list at the start of each iteration to show progress

## Current Iteration: 2 / 300

Now, work on the task. Good luck!
